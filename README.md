### **`my-shell-scripts`**

**A collection of my personal Linux shell scripts.**

### **Scripts**

This repository contains various shell scripts I use for my daily Linux tasks. Each script is self-contained, but you can explore them for more details and usage instructions.

### **Dependencies**

Most scripts run on a standard Linux environment. However, certain scripts require specific dependencies to function correctly.

  * `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`: Scripts that start with `yt-` (e.g., `yt-download.sh`) are designed for video and audio processing. These scripts require both **`yt-dlp`** and **`ffmpeg`** to be installed on your system.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yt-dlp ffmpeg

# On Fedora-based systems
sudo dnf install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```
